# Creating a GraphQL Server with Fastify, Mercurius and MongoDB

This repo accompanies an article which can be found [here](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/graphql-server-in-nodejs/).

The article discusses how to add a GraphQL endpoint to an already existing REST based API. As such, there are two directories in this project:

- the starter-code shows a functioning REST based API in Fastify
- the finished-code has taken that API and added on the GraphQL functionality.
